# The Anti-Code of Conduct

I am not your parent, your babysitter, or a prison warden, behave however you want. The choice on how you behave is your own, as well as any consequences it might incur. Either way, it isn't my business, and I definitely am not about to post some "guidelines" on a repo for open-source code about it. What an embarrassing world we live in that this has become so commonplace to include these cringe documents talking about "inclusion" and "safety", whatever that even means. I am fairly certain that nobody has ever died or even been injured by reading something on GitHub, yet here we are...

Want to harass someone? By all means, go right ahead. If it is me you are harassing within my own project, I might limit your ability to do so, I might not, depends on my mood, but either way I don't care enough to try and dictate your behavior. I am not a toddler, and am not going to get excited because some random person online wrote something that I didn't enjoy reading.

It is a testament to the stupidity of the world that GitHub nags me about including one of these, so here it is.
